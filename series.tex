\section*{Real functions}

In the following, uses of big-$O$ notation refer to the limit as $x \to a$.
Also, interval notation like $[a, x]$ refers to the closed interval of points between $x$ and $a$, disregarding which of $x$ and $a$ is greater.

\begin{tcolorbox}
  \begin{definition}
    Let $f : \R \to \R$ be $k$-times differentiable at $a$.  Then the $k$th \defn{Taylor polynomial} of $f$ at $a$ is
    \[P_k(x) \eqdef \sum_{i=0}^k \frac{f^{(i)}(a)}{i!} (x - a)^i\]
  \end{definition}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}
  \begin{theorem}[Taylor]
    Let $f$ be $k$-times differentiable at $a$.
    Then
    \[f(x) = P_k(x) + o\left(|x - a|^k\right)\]
  \end{theorem}
\end{tcolorbox}

\hidden{General mean value form}{
  \begin{lemma}[Mean value form]
    Suppose $f$ be continuous on $[a, x]$ and $(k+1)$-times differentiable on $(a, x)$.
    Choose any function $G$ which is continuous on $[a, x]$ and differentiable on $(a, x)$ with nonzero derivative.
    Then there exists $\xi \in (a, x)$ such that
    \[f(x) = P_k(x) + \frac{f^{(k+1)}(\xi)}{k!} (x - \xi)^k \frac{G(x) - G(a)}{G'(\xi)}\]
  \end{lemma}
}

\begin{theorem}[Lagrange mean value form]
  Let $f$ be continuous on $[a, x]$ and $(k+1)$-times differentiable on $(a, x)$.
  Then there exists $\xi \in (a, x)$ such that
  \[f(x) = P_k(x) + \frac{f^{(k+1)}(\xi)}{k!} (x - a)^{k+1}\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Cauchy mean value form]
  Let $f$ be continuous on $[a, x]$ and $(k+1)$-times differentiable on $(a, x)$.
  Then there exists $\xi \in (a, x)$ such that
  \[f(x) = P_k(x) + \frac{f^{(k+1)}(\xi)}{k!} (x - \xi)^k (x - a)\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{tcolorbox}
  \begin{corollary}
    Let $f$ be continuous on $[a, x]$ and suppose $|f^{(k+1)}|$ is bounded on $(a, x)$.
    Then
    \[f(x) = P_k(x) + O\left(|x - a|^{k+1}\right)\]
  \end{corollary}
\end{tcolorbox}
\begin{theorem}[Integral form]
  Let $f^{(k)}$ be absolutely continuous on $[a, x]$.
  Then
  \[f(x) = P_k(x) + \int_a^x \frac{f^{(k+1)}(t)}{k!} (x - t)^k\,dt\]  
\end{theorem}

For multivariate functions $\R^n \to \R$, a common strategy is to apply the univariate results above to $t \mapsto a + t(x - a)$
where $a$ and $x$ are points in $\R^n$.
